Little Bobby loves chocolate. He frequently goes to his favorite store, Penny Auntie, to buy them. They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. If Bobby saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate. 

Complete the chocolateFeast function. It must return the number of chocolates Bobby can eat after taking full advantage of the promotion.




int chocolateFeast(int n, int c, int m) 
{
    // n: total amount of money
    // c: cost of one chocolate
    // m: number of wrappers that can be swapped for one chocolate

    // numChocolates: return: total chocolates eaten
    // init to numPurchased
    int numChocolates = (n / c);

    // numWrappers: total wrappers available for trade-in
    // init to number of chocolates purchased
    int numWrappers = numChocolates;

    // loop while there are enough wrappers for a trade-in
    while (numWrappers >= m) 
    {
        // trade in largest number of wrappers divisible by m
        int numTraded = ((numWrappers / m) * m);

        // eat the chocolates received from the trade 
        int numEaten = (numTraded / m);

        // numWrappers: number of wrappers not used in this trade
        // plus wrappers from the chocolates received from the trade
        numWrappers -= numTraded;
        numWrappers += numEaten;

        // increment total eaten
        numChocolates += numEaten;
    }

    return numChocolates;
}
